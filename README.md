# ROS_Drone
We are using ROS (Robot Operating System) in our drone to implement simple functionalities in a cost-effective manner.

First, we installed a lightweight ROS distribution called ROS Noetic on the Raspberry Pi. You can use any other ROS distribution as well, depending on your requirements.

Next, we used MAVROS to configure the Raspberry Pi to communicate with the flight controller. This enables us to perform basic operations such as takeoff and landing.

For camera integration, we used the usb_cam ROS driver to capture and process video streams from the camera connected to the Raspberry Pi.

This setup allows us to achieve essential drone functionalities while keeping the system lightweight and cost-effective.
